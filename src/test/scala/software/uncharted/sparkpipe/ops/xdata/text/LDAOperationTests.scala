I drew a graph/tree for it and this screams to use recursion. But I would like to do this without recursion, if this is possible.",

There are two interesting questions we might investigate here: How many levels deep into the stack is the current code? How many levels of recursion can the current method reach before it hits a StackOverflowError?",

        "I want to build a guitar tuner app for Iphone. My goal is to find the fundamental frequency of sound generated by a guitar string. I have used bits of code from aurioTouch sample provided by Apple to calculate frequency spectrum and I find the frequency with the highest amplitude . It works fine for pure sounds (the ones that have only one frequency) but for sounds from a guitar string it produces wrong results. I have read that this is because of the overtones generate by the guitar string that might have higher amplitudes than the fundamental one. How can I find the fundamental frequency so it works for guitar strings? Is there an open-source library in C/C++/Obj-C for sound analyzing (or signal processing)?",

And basic information like the tuning of the instruments in the song would be very useful parameters to retrieve from the file and add to the database.",

So my question: Is that possible to receive data (button clicks) from the Guitar Hero (or Rock Band) controllers on Android device? Would the Android understand it as a gamepad input? P.S. all I need is to detect in my game the input from those five buttons on the plastic guitar fret.",

When displayed, I'd like to see the lyrics rendered double-spaced with the chords in the \"whitespace\" line above the corresponding words. This is for my own personal lyrics book so ultimately the rendering will be most commonly on dead trees vs a screen but this may change eventually. I figured I'd give Markdown a shot and was able to get the following format \"sort of\" working when combined with some CSS to have <a> tags render as quasi-superscripts. I kind of like how using the <a> tag worked out, because I can have reference links on the bottom of the file for any included chords:",

So far I have managed to get the FFT to work so I can detect pitch frequency (Hz) then by using an algorithm and the table below I can manage to determine the octave (2th to 6th) and the note (C to B) for played note. The next step is to detect the string so I can determine the fret.",

Any suggestions on how to go about it? One idea I got from reading some stackoverflow posts was to use a strict ASCII tab format like so: It has advantages. I can gain a lot of info from the structure (how many strings, their tunings, the relative placement of notes) but it is a bit verbose. I'm guessing the '-'s will compress away pretty well when sent over the wire.",

My concern is how would I go about to make sure the timing is correct_(I'm gonna have to convert these beat values into ms instead)_? The files I'm parsing hold values such as these; Where the first integer is at what beat the note should occur, N is whether or not the note is a hammer-on, then the Fret ID_(Green or Red etc)_ and the length of the note, again in beats."
