// These two classes, taken together, should form the basis of a two-stage line projection, wherein the first stage
// spreads a line out over tiles, and the second, over bins within a tile.
//
// This is useful in two ways:
//
// First of all, in our old code in aperture-tiles, it was faster than the one-stage version currently in use.
// However, with the change in the core of tiling to use combineByKey, this may or may not still be the case - it
// requires testing to be sure.
//
// Secondly, one can use the first stage alone to generate vector- instead of raster- tiles.
//
// The effort to finish these two stages was stymied by the lack of an ability in salt at the time to pull
// projection information into value generation (or vice versa).  This is a case where the projection and the
// spreader function need some knowledge of each other.  The ability to do this was scheduled for salt a while ago,
// and at some point, when we are ready to complete this work, the next stage is to uncomment the
//    extends SpreadingFunction[(Int, Int, Int), (Int, Int, Int, Int), T]
// line in the second stage, and continue from there.
//
// At the moment, however, this is only a partially completed effort.
